As an exercise in integrating with the YouTube Data API, learning more about Bootstrap, and practicing transitions, Iâ€™ve put together a [simple viewer](https://stupefied-pare-d01de5.netlify.app).

The app allows users to search, view and maintain a list of favourites locally and ideally is a lot less noisy than viewing videos on any YouTube platform.

Future additions may include:
- error handling after unsuccessful API calls
- building out a mobile-version
- OAuth integration to allow users to use their YouTube accounts
- A bit more creativity on the presentation front
