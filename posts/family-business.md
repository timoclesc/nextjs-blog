I made my first website from [scratch](http://coplandconstructions.com.au). Coded it up, character by character, without much in the way of fancy tools, and sent it to the internet.

It's the old man's business and it's been in need of new website for the last half a decade. Have you ever seen GoDaddy's website builder before? That was what I used as quick fix with the intention of building out something properly later, and I'm incredibly relieved I don't have a screenshot to show you what is now dead and buried. Basically MS Paint.
