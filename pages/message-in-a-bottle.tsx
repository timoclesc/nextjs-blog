Every time I come and listen to the line call it appears you have anticipated almost every scenario the offence might face, prepared various counter attacks, and are able to convert complex instructions into a 10s brief that also gives players the space to trust their instincts. \n \nAmongst all the scheming and strat talk, you found moments to give players small gestures of encouragement, which meant a great deal to me when I was finding my feet in Europe.\n\nThank you for all of the hard work you have put into this campaign to set us up for success at WUC. I hope we can do justice to your efforts.\nSplAsh"

And how with expectation programs, you either reach the line, or you don't and fail. But you've given us this fantastic program built on a model of trust. You trust us to do the work. We trust you to guide us. And there's so much understanding and support for where we each are or how we actually do it. And as a result, we've all gone higher and higher than any expectations based program would ever have taken us. That gym session in Europe was so inspiring. I've never seen a whole team so onboard with a program before, and this has been your doing. ~ Phish Millips",
